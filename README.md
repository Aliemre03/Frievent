# Frievent

This is a mobile application for those people who have certain hobbies but do not have friends who have those hobbies. Or who wants to make friends in a country or city they donâ€™t know at all. It will help people to make new friends and meet new people, thanks to their common hobbies and activities that they wish to do.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

### Tech stack

- Spring Boot
- Kotlin
- PostgreSQL

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `src/main/kotlin/com/frievent/bitirme/BitirmeApplication.kt` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## About the Service
